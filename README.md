# Cloning a Repository

This guide will take you through the steps required to clone a repository.

2. Above the list of files, click on the green **Code** button.
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", click the clipboard icon to copy the repository clone URL.
4. Open your terminal (Mac/Linux) or command prompt/PowerShell (Windows).
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.
